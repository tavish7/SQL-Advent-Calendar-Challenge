> This is a 24 Day challenge hosted by [Dawn Choo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/data-dawn/).<br> 

This challenge started on 1st Dec 2024, where you get new questions each day. 

This is a good start if someone is practicing SQL at any level. The questions are randomized based on different levels *(easy, medium and hard).*

Best part is you can try to execute your query multiple times *i.e.* you have ***multiple attempts*** to solve the question and even you get ***hints*** if you get stucked in any of the question.
